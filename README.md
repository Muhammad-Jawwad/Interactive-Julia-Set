# Interactive-Julia-Set

# Introduction

Julia Set is a mathematical fractal, that is famous for its spooky and chaos pattens. Mathematically it is definied as for a given complex number $c\in\mathbb{C}$, all numbers in the complex domain let say $z$ will be mapped according to the mapping $z\to z^2+c$.

$$ c\in\mathbb{C},\forall z\in\mathbb{C},\forall n\in\mathbb{N}, z_{n+1}\to z^{2}_{n}+c $$
